# shell
Linux shell-based application

To run the program, type: shell

Once you're in the shell, you can type in any of the commands below. Up and down arrow keys will retrieve a previously entered command. The hist command gets the history of the last 10 entered items, and the find command is used to locate a file in a given directory.

--> cd 

--> cd (directory path)

--> ls

--> pwd

--> hist

--> find (directory path) (file name)
